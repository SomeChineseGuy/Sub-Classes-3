### To Do

- [ ] Project Management
- [ ] Planning out a project
- [ ] Keeping track of tasks
- [ ] Keeping track of time
- [ ] Staying organized

### Waterfall

- Tradition way of planning a project
- You would plan out the whole project from the beginning
- You would then build the whole app based which part it is
- Everything is done with pre-planning
- Once launch is completed no more support
- Fixed/inflexible schedule

### Aglie

- Philosophy

### Scrum

- Product backlog
  - all of the features needed to finish the app (product goals)
  - Order the list
- Sprint backlog (usually 2 weeks)
  - piece of a whole
- Sprint Execution
  - app is frozen
  - The whole team is responsible for delivering a product

### Scrum Team

- Product owner (Think of this person as the GM)
  - talking to the stakeholders
  - coming up with the product backlog
  - making sure it's commiunciated correctly
- Dev
  - Worker ants of this project
- Scrum master
  - Manager
  - Helps the team plan and move effectivly

### Planning the project

1. User stories
2. Nouns/resources
3. ERD
4. Routes
5. Wireframes/mockups

## Example Login

### Waterfall login

- First you list ALL of the features
- Login and out
- Register a new account
- Forget my password
- 2auth
- Password changes
- Reset password
- Password hashing
- Can make up to 3000 read request per min
- can make up to 1000 write request per min

### After listing all the features

- Writing your ERD
- Building your database
- We then build our routes, do the hashing, the security
- Then we are gonna do the frontend - we got designs and we got cookies and local storage and stuff.

- This takes 10 weeks
- 3 weeks on planning/DB
- 4 weeks on backend
- 2 weeks on frontend
- 1 week on test

- Someone comes to you and said
- we need google auth
- after that we may also need github auth and facebook auth

### Example login with Aglie

- We list all of the features

## When we start building

- we ask ourselves how much can we build in 2 weeks

- First Sprint - our goal is to finish these 2 features
  *Login and out
  *Register a new account
- Second Sprint
  *Password changes
  *Reset password
  \*Stretch feature - Password hashing
- Third Sprint
  *Forget my password
  *2auth
